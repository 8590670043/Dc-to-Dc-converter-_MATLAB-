# Dc-to-Dc-converter-_MATLAB-
Hybrid DC to DC transformerless converter that efficiently steps up a 20V DC input to 240V DC output. It utilizes a combination of switched capacitor techniques and a voltage multiplier to achieve high voltage gain without using a bulky transformer. The design is optimized for compactness, efficiency, and reliability
